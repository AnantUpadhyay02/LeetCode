# DSA Problems Solutions in C++ 

This repository contains solutions to common data structures and algorithms problems using C++.

## Description

I am using this repository to practice implementing basic data structures and solving algorithm problems in C++.

The solutions are organized as the question on LeetCode.

Data Structures and Algorithms topics I'll be covering are as follows:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Math
- Bit Manipulation

The code is well commented to explain the logic and approach.

## Contents

Each topic folder contains one or more .cpp files with solutions to problems for that topic. 

For example:
1013-fibonacci-number/ 

class Solution {
public:
    
    int fib(int n) {
        if(n==0)
            return 0;
        if(n==1)
            return 1;

    
     return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
        
    }
};
